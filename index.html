      <h1>Kids' Interactive Song Maker - Reflection</h1>

      <h2>Guiding Values and UI Design</h2>
      <p>
        My design focused on
        <strong>playfulness, accessibility, and immediate feedback</strong>. The
        interface encourages children to explore music visually and aurally. I
        used a colourful gradient background, large icon buttons for song
        selection, and animated shapes that respond to user interaction. The
        Bubblegum Sans font and playful icons reinforce a kid-friendly
        aesthetic. Volume control and mute functionality provide safe audio
        interaction.
      </p>

      <h2>Feedback, Information Design, Mapping, and Learnability</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Feedback:</strong> Clicking or tapping creates sound and
          animated shapes, giving immediate auditory and visual confirmation.
          Volume changes update the icon in real time, and active songs are
          highlighted.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Information Design:</strong> Instructions appear briefly and
          fade out, keeping the interface uncluttered.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mapping:</strong> Song buttons are at the top center, volume
          controls at the top right, and the interactive canvas fills the
          remaining area.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Learnability:</strong> Intuitive icons and minimal
          instructions make it easy for children to explore without prior
          guidance.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Significant Changes Since Work-in-Progress</h2>
      <p>
        I implemented the volume control with mute toggle, refined the shape
        animations for smoother motion, added fail-safe logic for icons, and
        ensured the audio context resumes reliably on interaction.
      </p>

      <h2>Production Timeline and Process</h2>
      <p>
        Development started with the p5.js canvas and basic interaction logic.
        The second phase focused on UI design and visual feedback. The final
        phase added advanced features like volume control, mute functionality,
        oscillator management, and responsive resizing. Features were tested
        iteratively to ensure accurate visual and audio feedback.
      </p>

      <h2>Most Proud Design Aspect</h2>
      <p>
        I am most proud of the
        <strong>integration of visual and auditory feedback</strong>. Each tap
        produces a dynamic, colourful shape with the correct note, making the
        interface engaging and fun.
      </p>

      <h2>Most Challenging Design Aspect</h2>
      <p>
        Managing <strong>audio context and oscillators</strong> was challenging.
        I had to ensure sounds stop correctly when muted, handle multiple
        oscillators, and resume the audio context across browsers.
      </p>

      <h2>Creative Prompt and Advanced Techniques</h2>
      <p>
        This project follows the <strong>No Text Characters</strong> prompt.
        Interaction relies on icons, shapes, and sound. I used
        <strong>Math.random()</strong> extensively to generate random colours,
        shapes, and positions, creating a unique experience with each
        interaction.
