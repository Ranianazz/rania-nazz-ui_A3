      <h1>Kids' Interactive Song Maker - Reflection</h1>

      <h2>Guiding Values and UI Design</h2>
      <p>
        My design focused on
        <strong>playfulness, accessibility, and immediate feedback</strong>. The
        interface encourages children to explore music visually and aurally. I
        used a colourful gradient background, large icon buttons for song
        selection, and animated shapes that respond to user interaction. The
        Bubblegum Sans font and playful icons reinforce a kid-friendly
        aesthetic. Volume control and mute functionality provide safe audio
        interaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        I designed this project to give parents with toddlers a reliable online
        instrumental toy that is safe, ad-free, and easy to use. Children can
        experiment with sound and shapes without external distractions, making
        it a fun and secure environment for musical play.
      </p>

      <h2>JavaScript and Interactive Functionality</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript is the core of this project, handling interactivity, sound,
        and visuals. I used <strong>p5.js</strong> to create and manage the
        canvas and shapes, and the <strong>Web Audio API</strong> for sound
        generation. Together, they allow children to click or tap and instantly
        see and hear the results.
      </p>

      <p>
        The code keeps track of important states like the <em>current song</em>,
        <em>note index</em>, <em>volume</em>, <em>mute status</em>, and
        <em>active oscillators</em>. For example, the note sequences for each
        song are stored in an object:
      </p>

      <pre>
const songs = {
  itsy: { notes: [0,0,1,2,2,1,0], durations: [0.4,0.4,0.4,0.5,0.5,0.4,0.8] },
  twinkle: { notes: [0,0,3,3,4,4,3], durations: [0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.8] }
};
      </pre>

      <p>
        When the user clicks, an oscillator is created to play the corresponding
        note, while a colorful shape appears at the click location:
      </p>

      <pre>
const osc = new p5.Oscillator('sine');
osc.freq(frequency);
osc.start();
osc.stop(audioContext.currentTime + duration);
shapes.push(new DancingShape(x, y, size, color));
      </pre>

      <p>
        Volume and mute functionality are fully controlled with JavaScript.
        Event listeners update the slider, stop oscillators if muted, and change
        icons dynamically:
      </p>

      <pre>
volumeSlider.addEventListener('input', () =&gt; {
  currentVolume = parseFloat(volumeSlider.value);
  if(currentVolume === 0) {
    oscillators.forEach(osc =&gt; osc.stop());
  }
});
      </pre>

      <p>
        The draw loop in p5.js continuously updates shapes to create lively
        animations:
      </p>

      <pre>
function draw() {
  clear();
  for (let shape of shapes) {
    shape.update();  // Move and fade shape
    shape.display(); // Draw shape
  }
}
      </pre>

      <p>
        JavaScript also manages song selection. Clicking a song button resets
        the note sequence and highlights the selected song, allowing children to
        experience rhythm while exploring creatively.
      </p>

      <h2>Feedback, Information Design, Mapping, and Learnability</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Feedback:</strong> Clicking or tapping creates sound and
          animated shapes, giving immediate auditory and visual confirmation.
          Volume changes update the icon in real time, and active songs are
          highlighted.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Information Design:</strong> Instructions appear briefly and
          fade out, keeping the interface uncluttered.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mapping:</strong> Song buttons are at the top center, volume
          controls at the top right, and the interactive canvas fills the
          remaining area.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Learnability:</strong> Intuitive icons and minimal
          instructions make it easy for children to explore without prior
          guidance.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Significant Changes Since Work-in-Progress</h2>
      <p>
        I implemented the volume control with mute toggle, refined the shape
        animations for smoother motion, added fail-safe logic for icons, and
        ensured the audio context resumes reliably on interaction.
      </p>

      <h2>Production Timeline and Process</h2>
      <p>
        Development started with the p5.js canvas and basic interaction logic.
        The second phase focused on UI design and visual feedback. The final
        phase added advanced features like volume control, mute functionality,
        oscillator management, and responsive resizing. Features were tested
        iteratively to ensure accurate visual and audio feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reflecting on the JavaScript process, managing multiple oscillators and
        the audio context was the most complex part. Debugging and refining the
        timing of notes and animations helped me understand how to synchronise
        visuals with sound effectively.
      </p>

      <h2>Most Proud Design Aspect</h2>
      <p>
        I am most proud of the
        <strong>integration of visual and auditory feedback</strong>. Each tap
        produces a dynamic, colourful shape with the correct note, making the
        interface engaging and fun.
      </p>

      <h2>Most Challenging Design Aspect</h2>
      <p>
        Managing <strong>audio context and oscillators</strong> was challenging.
        I had to ensure sounds stop correctly when muted, handle multiple
        oscillators, and resume the audio context across browsers.
      </p>

      <h2>Evaluation and Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        I think the project works well: children can explore sound and shapes
        intuitively, and parents can feel confident that the toy is safe and
        ad-free. The interface provides clear, immediate feedback, and the
        random shapes keep play engaging.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the future, I would approach this differently by adding a more
        educational element. For example, shapes could display their names or
        random letters could appear on interaction, so children would be
        learning as they play with the instrumental toy.
      </p>

      <h2>Creative Prompt and Advanced Techniques</h2>
      <p>
        This project follows the <strong>No Text Characters</strong> prompt.
        Interaction relies on icons, shapes, and sound. I used
        <strong>Math.random()</strong> extensively to generate random colours,
        shapes, and positions, creating a unique experience with each
        interaction.
